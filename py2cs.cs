// 1. Create an input that takes an integer and outputs "True" for even numbers or "False" for odd numbers. Hint: Result might be an error, try to research "type casting" and fix it.


// 2. Create inputs for three numbers, output "True" if first two numbers are equal to or greater than a third number, otherwise output "False".


// 3. Create inputs for three numbers, output "True" if any of first two numbers is divisible by a third number without a remainder.


// 4. Create two seperate inputs for a First Name and a Last Name, output should look like this example: "Full Name is Brad Pitt". Use only one print() function.


// 5. Add a third input for age, output should look like this example: "Age of Brad Pitt is 58". Use only one print() function.


// 6. Take values of length and width of a rectangle from user and print if it's a square or not. ("It is a square"/"It is not a square")


// 7. Take two int values from user and print greatest among them. Use one-line if else only.

// 15. Create a program to print a multiplication table of a received input number.

// 16. Take an input from a user and find the factorial of a number.

// 17. Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms. Note that first two terms are 0 and 1.

// 18. Take an input from a user, check if the number is prime or not. ("It's a prime number/It's not a prime number")

// 19. Take an input from a user, print every prime number from 1 to X.
