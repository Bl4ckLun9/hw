// 1. Create an input that takes an integer and outputs "True" for even numbers or "False" for odd numbers. Hint: Result might be an error, try to research "type casting" and fix it.


# 2. Create inputs for three numbers, output "True" if first two numbers are equal to or greater than a third number, otherwise output "False".


# 3. Create inputs for three numbers, output "True" if any of first two numbers is divisible by a third number without a remainder.


# 4. Create two seperate inputs for a First Name and a Last Name, output should look like this example: "Full Name is Brad Pitt". Use only one print() function.


# 5. Add a third input for age, output should look like this example: "Age of Brad Pitt is 58". Use only one print() function.
